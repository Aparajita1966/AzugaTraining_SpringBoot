# AzugaTraining_SpringBoot

Hello and welcome to my Java training notes.

This repository contains Java codes for various scenarios and was created during Azuga's Month 2 training under the direction and guidance of CodeOps. The codes were written over the course of four weeks and will be available on the Github repository for future referencing and upgrades. Any and all contributions are welcome.

## Requirements
​
There are no such prerequisites. Although, a suitable JDK (preferably JDK 11 or higher) and an IDE must be installed.

For simplicity, this project is built using the Gradle build tool on the IntelliJ IDE.

All the necessary dependencies mentioned in the list must be imported for the programs to run error free.

## Roadmap

The whole project is divided into weekly tasks and are as follows:

- [Week 1](https://github.com/Aparajita1966/AzugaTraining_SpringBoot/tree/MySQL_Museum_CRUD) : Week 1's aim was to connect to MySQL and set up necessary environment for executing queries on the Museum API data. For the same, we created a database schema, stored the data, and performed CRUD activities. Additionally, a [UI](https://github.com/Aparajita1966/AzugaTraining_SpringBoot/tree/MySQL_Museum_UI) layer was developed, and a server connection was made from the backend to the frontend to render museum data.

- [Week 2](https://github.com/Aparajita1966/AzugaTraining_SpringBoot/tree/MySQL_Museum_UI) : Week 2's aim was to improve the user-interface UI layer for CRUD operations on the museum data and to handle errors and exceptional cases correctly for both the frontend and the backend. Then developed SQL queries in Java for MuseumDB's analytics portion. Created the database structure, carried out CRUD operations on the [Employees](https://github.com/Aparajita1966/AzugaTraining_SpringBoot/tree/MySQL_Employee_CRUD) data, and built SQL queries for the analytics part of the EmployeesDB in Java.

- [Week 3](https://github.com/Aparajita1966/AzugaTraining_SpringBoot/tree/Mongo_Museum_CRUD) : Week 3's aim was to get started with Mongo and establish up connections for interaction both locally and remotely. Also, become acquainted with and conduct CRUD operations with operators, array operations, aggregations, and search. In order to perform further activities, we then required to store the Museum API data in Mongo. In addition, work was done on MapReduce, Indexing, Embedded Documents, and Validation Schema.

- [Week 4](https://github.com/Aparajita1966/AzugaTraining_SpringBoot/tree/Mongo_Museum_UIwithfeatures) : Week 4's task was to work on MongoTools and SQL converter tools, as well as to build GridFs, Sharding, and Replication. Additionally, use Java to render the Mongo database's museum data and build a user interface layer with features like pagination, filtering, and sorting. Finally, I worked on Mongo with Node.JS and performed operations to comprehend the fundamentals.

NOTE: To minimise confusion, the [Node.JS](https://github.com/Aparajita1966/AzugaTraining_NodeJSwithMongo) task is in a separate repository.
